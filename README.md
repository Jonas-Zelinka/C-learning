# C-learning
Little files who explain something in "C"

you can use my "first.c" file to prog your programs into it...its filled with standard #includeÂ´s that you will need for anything.
and has a simpel error checking function...
Have fun with it!!

the rest of the files are simple explaining files for some functions in C like the struct.c file, explain struct functions and
how to use it correctly, also with pointer (DE: Zeiger).

Some files are in German (DE) but the newer files are complete in Englisch (EN).
I hope you can learn something and please let some constructive opiniens and improvements there for me
